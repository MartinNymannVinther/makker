# Security Policy

Makker is a multi-tenant chat to think out loud with; workspace isolation,
the privacy of one person's conversation and data protection are its most
important properties. We take every report
seriously and appreciate the time it takes to make one.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- Email **security@haij.dk** with a description, reproduction steps and the
  impact you believe it has. Danish or English both work.
- Please do not open public issues for security problems, and do not access
  or modify data belonging to workspaces that are not your own test data.
- You will get an acknowledgement within 72 hours and a status update at
  least every two weeks until the issue is resolved.
- We aim to fix confirmed vulnerabilities within 90 days and will credit
  you in the release notes if you want.

There is currently no bug bounty program.

## Scope notes

Particularly interesting: anything that lets one workspace read or write
another workspace's data (RLS bypass), authentication bypass, audit-log
tampering, an invitation link that admits somebody it should not, a colleague or an
owner reading a conversation that is not theirs, a prompt that reaches the
model as instructions rather than data because of what a document
contained, personal data slipping past the browser filter, and injection
of any kind. The RLS test suite in `tests/rls/` is
the executable specification of the isolation model.

## Supported versions

Pre-1.0, only the latest `main` is supported.
